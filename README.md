# Virtual-assistant
Sarah Green is a virtual assistant at Greenhouse, showing that Digital Humans can help us and make our life easier. 

The story
I created a interaction between the user and the virtual assistant, where the user choices affect the interaction.

Frameworks used
I have used the framework BotUI for the virtual assistant. This is a framework that lets you easily create a chatbot. I have however made changes to this framework to make it suit my needs.

How does it work?
Do you want to know more about how the BotUI code works? Check the fastpass.html and fastpass.js pages. These have detailed code about how the framework is used in this instance.
